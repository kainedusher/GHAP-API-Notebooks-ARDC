This repo contains a demo Jupyter notebook on how to make calls to GHAP's place search API. In particular, it shows how to conduct fuzzy search, bounding box search, and how to save search results.

More guides and demos are intended to be added in the future.

This notebook can either be cloned and run on your local machine or accessed via Nectar's BinderHub Service.
